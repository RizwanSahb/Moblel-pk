A new Note 12 smartphone from Infinix, dubbed the VIP, has been announced. The Chinese firm is now developing a new, more reasonably priced smartphone. This new device, part of the Note line, will have a name soon. The MediaTek MT6781 Helio G96, one of the newest chipsets for smartphones, will provide the juice for this mobile device. The new Infinix Note 12 VIP is powered by a 2.05 GHz Octa-core processor. The next smartphone's screen measures in at a whopping 6.7 inches, making it one of the largest in the industry. The new Infinix Note 12 VIP boasts a full HD display with a resolution of 1080 x 2400 Pixels and a Capacitive AMOLED Capacitive Touchscreen. In addition, a Mali-G57 MC2 GPU is included. The Infinix Note 12 has 8 GB of RAM, the most amount available in this smartphone, so you can expect your device to perform at lightning speed. The Note 12 VIP by Infinix has 256 GB of internal storage, so your data is effectively endless. The smartphone has a triple camera system on its back. The Infinix 12 VIP's primary sensor will have a whopping 108 megapixels. The phone's ultrawide camera will have 13 megapixels, and the depth sensor will have 2 megapixels. The 16-megapixel resolution of the front-facing camera on this device will make selfies a breeze.

Fast charging at 120W is built into the Note 12 VIP's (Li-Po Non-removable) 4500 mAh battery, providing ample backup time. With the release of 12 VIP, Samsung and other smartphone manufacturers will have new competition.
